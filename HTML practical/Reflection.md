Basic HTML Structure
<html>: The root element.
<head>: Contains metadata and the page title (<title> tag).
<body>: Contains the main content, in this case, the heading (<h1>) and the table (<table>).

  
2. Table Structure
Table Elements:
<table>: The container for the tabular data.
<thead> and <tbody>: Separate the table's header from its body. The header contains the days of the week, while the body contains the schedule details.
<th>: Table header cells, used for both the day names and the "Time Slot" label.
<td>: Table data cells, used for the subjects and time slots.
Row spanning: The colspan attribute is used in the lunch break row (<td colspan="5">) to span the lunch break across all five days.

  
3. CSS for Styling
Internal CSS (within <style> tag): Used to style the table and make it visually clear and readable.
Table Layout:
border-collapse: collapse; merges borders between cells, making the table look cleaner.
Borders are applied to both <th> and <td> cells using border: 1px solid #000;.
Padding ensures there is space inside the cells, and text-align: center; ensures that all text is centered within its cell.
Background Color: The table header (<th>) uses background-color: #f2f2f2; for a subtle grey tone, visually separating it from the rest of the table.
Responsive Font: The body uses a basic sans-serif font (Arial), making the content easy to read.
