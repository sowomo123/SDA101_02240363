1.Create a custom element called "toggle-button" that:

Displays a button that toggles between ON/OFF states
Changes color based on state (green for ON, red for OFF)
Dispatches a custom event called "toggle-changed" when clicked
Maintains its state even if the page reloads (using localStorage)
Create a custom element called "user-profile" that displays a user's name and role. The element should accept "name" and "role" attributes. Style it to have a card-like appearance with a border and padding.

2.Create the UserProfile class that extends HTMLElement
Define the custom element
Add a template with basic styling
