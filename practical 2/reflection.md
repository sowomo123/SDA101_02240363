1. Describe the main concepts you applied?
the main concepts that i used here is  Frames and Artboards
grids and layout
Typography Styles
Color Styles
Components and UI Elements
Prototyping & Interactions

2. Discuss new skills or knowledge acquired 
knowledge that i acquire here is abouts images and Icons
Unsplash Plugin: I often use the Unsplash plugin in Figma to add high-quality images directly to my designs. This helps visualize how images will fit within the design without needing to download them separately.
Icon Plugins: I use Figma plugins like Iconify or Feather Icons to insert a variety of vector icons. These are scalable and customizable for web designs.

3. Discuss what you learned.
i learn about Constraints: I use constraints to control how objects behave when the frame size changes. For example, I can set constraints to make a button’s position or size relative to the frame or other elements, ensuring it adapts well to different screen sizes.
Auto Layout: This feature is crucial for creating responsive, flexible designs. Auto Layout allows components (like buttons or text) to automatically resize or adjust when the container's size changes, which is particularly useful for designing across devices.

4. challenges and solution u faced?
problem: When designing a website with complex user flows (e.g., multiple screens with a variety of actions or forms), it’s easy to lose track of the overall user journey. Ensuring the flow is logical, clear, and seamless is a critical challenge.
Solution:
User Flow Diagrams: Start by mapping out the user flow or journey. You can use Figma to create wireframes or flow diagrams to visualize how users will navigate through your website. This helps identify any bottlenecks or areas where users may get lost.
