1. Describe the main concepts you applied?
concept i have applied here is UI Design (User Interface Design) and UX Design (User Experience Design)

2. Discuss new skills or knowledge acquired 
the knowledge i acquire here is frames and Artboards: In Figma, a "Frame" is essentially a container that holds all elements of your design. It is similar to an artboard in other tools like Sketch or Adobe XD. Frames can be used to design specific screens or components.

3. Discuss what you learned.
i learnt about Wireframing is the first stage in UI/UX design, where you layout the basic structure of your app or website without focusing on design details like colors and fonts.
In Figma, wireframes can be created using simple shapes, placeholders, and text.
Wireframe Kits: Figma has various pre-made wireframe kits that help speed up the process, especially for mobile and web apps.
4. challenges and solution u faced?
Problem: Designing an intuitive interface requires a deep understanding of the target users. Without comprehensive research, designers might build products that donâ€™t align with user expectations or behaviors.
Solution:
User Research: Conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather insights directly from users.
Personas: Create user personas that represent key segments of your target audience. These personas help keep the design focused on user needs and behaviors.
